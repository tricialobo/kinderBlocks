## KinderBlocks

KinderBlocks facilitates storage of foster child records on a consortium blockchain.

How:

Case workers (teachers, social workers, etc.) can create a block for a particular child.
Upon updates in that child's life (school switches, adoption, etc.) they can make updates, at which point a token is transferred to that person's account.
Upon making an update, the other stakeholders on the blockchain are updated.
If there are no updates for more than one week, all involved are contacted and asked for an update.
