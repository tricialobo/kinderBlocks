## KinderBlocks

KinderBlocks will facilitate the storage of foster child records on a consortium blockchain.

How:
A block (smart contract) is created for each child entering the foster care system. Upon changes in that child's life, case workers make updates that are stored in the smart contract, triggering transfer of one cryptocurrency token to the case worker's account. Team members are contacted if there are no updates for a period of time.
